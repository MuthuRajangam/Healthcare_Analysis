Analyzing healthcare data using SQL and Power BI.



**Healthcare Data Analysis**: Payment Posted, Denied Claims, and AR Status
This project involves analyzing healthcare payment data to assess payment statuses, denied claims, and accounts receivable (AR) information for the period of May to September. The analysis was performed using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for data visualization. Additionally, data cleaning and transformation techniques were applied to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the analysis.

**Project Overview**
This repository contains the following:

**Data Extraction**: SQL queries were used to pull data from the healthcare database, focusing on the key metrics: posted payments, denied claims, and AR status.

**Data Cleaning & Transformation:** The data was cleaned and transformed to handle missing values, correct errors, and standardize formats to make it suitable for analysis.

**Power BI Reports:** Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations to help stakeholders better understand trends in payment processing, denial rates, and AR status over time.

Key Metrics Analyzed

**Payment Posted:** This metric shows the payments successfully posted to the system.

**Denied Claims**: This tracks claims that have been denied by insurance providers, including reasons for denial and denial rates.

**AR Status:** This includes the accounts receivable (AR) status of outstanding claims, helping to track the collection cycle and identify bottlenecks.

**Data Analysis Workflow**

**SQL Queries:**

Data extraction was done through SQL, focusing on the key columns for payments, claims status, and AR data.
Filters were applied to extract data between May and September.

**Data Cleaning:**

Removed or filled missing data points.
Corrected inconsistencies in date formats, payment amounts, and claim status.

**Data Transformation:**

Standardized categories of payment statuses (Posted, Denied, Pending).
Converted the data into a suitable format for Power BI analysis.

**Power BI Visualization:**

Developed dashboards and reports to visualize trends in posted payments, denied claims, and AR status.
Utilized bar charts, line graphs, and tables to display the status of payments, claim denials, and outstanding receivables over the five-month period.
**Tools Used**

**SQL:** For data extraction and querying from healthcare databases.

**Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and reports.

**Excel (Optional):** For any additional data manipulation or validation before importing into Power BI.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Applied using both SQL and Power BI data modeling features.


**Conclusion**

This healthcare data analysis provides insights into the payment posting cycle, claim denials, and accounts receivable status. By utilizing SQL and Power BI, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the data and make more informed decisions to improve payment processing and collections.
